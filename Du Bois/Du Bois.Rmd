# Get the package
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
```

# Get the data
```{r download data}
freed_slaves <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-02-16/freed_slaves.csv')

```

# Design intent
I'm thinking of re-creating this:

![](`r "https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c7ef2769-eae9-445c-b27f-6814ed9fd112/sign1070-fig-0003-m.png"`)

I guess its a stacked area chart?

# Shaping
But, the `freed_slaves` data isn't tidy. There are two colums of numeric data for the levels of the factor rather than a factor with the level and a factor with the numeric value.

```{r}
freed_slaves_tidy <- freed_slaves %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = !Year, 
               names_to = "person",
               values_to = "percent")
  
```

# Ploting
```{r}
freed_slaves_tidy %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = percent, fill = person)) + 
    geom_area()
```

# Checks
At 1800 it look like there are less than 100%. This is worth a check:

```{r}
freed_slaves %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(sum = sum(Slave, Free)) %>%
  kable()
```

But that's the data so I'm going to leave it as is.

# Aesthetics
Time to set the colours and add the text.

```{r}

freed_slaves_tidy %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = percent, fill = person)) + 
  geom_area() +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#00aa00", "#000000")) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "PROORTION OF FREEMEN AND SLAVES AMONG AMERICAN NEGROES", 
       subtitle ="DONE BY ATLANTA UNIVERSITY")

```
